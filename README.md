# AzerothCore Rebuild/Update Script

This script is designed to help you **update**, **build**, **run**, and **manage** your **AzerothCore** server â€” a popular server emulator for **World of Warcraft**. It simplifies common tasks such as updating the source code, managing dependencies, rebuilding the server, handling server processes, managing backups, viewing logs, and configuring operational parameters via an external file.

---

## Features:
- **Dependency Check**: Automatically checks for essential software like `git`, `cmake`, `make`, `clang`, `clang++`, `tmux`, etc. If missing, it will prompt you to install them.
- **Source Code Update**: Allows you to update your existing AzerothCore server's source code from its Git repository.
- **Rebuilding the Server**: Uses `cmake` and `make` to rebuild and reinstall the updated AzerothCore server, with an option to specify the number of CPU cores for faster builds.
- **Process Management**: Advanced control over server processes, including starting, stopping, restarting, and checking the status of `authserver` and `worldserver` within their TMUX session.
- **Backup and Restore**: Easily backup your server's databases (world, characters, auth) and server configuration files (`worldserver.conf`, `authserver.conf`). Restore from existing backups.
- **Log Viewer**: View script operation logs, as well as live (`tail -f`) or static (`less`) `authserver` and `worldserver` logs directly through the script.
- **Module Management**: Helps you to update all or individual custom modules located in your `modules` directory.
- **External Configuration**: Persistent settings via an external configuration file (`~/.ACrebuild/ACrebuild.conf`), making it easy to customize paths, credentials (with caution for passwords), and other operational parameters.
- **Flexible Menu System**: Interactive menus guide you through various operations.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download the script) to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Stuntmonkey4u/ACrebuild.git
    cd ACrebuild
    chmod +x ACrebuild.sh
    ```
2.  **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    ./ACrebuild.sh
    ```
    The script will guide you through initial setup, including the location of your AzerothCore installation if it's not in the default path (`~/azerothcore`).

## How It Works

When you run `ACrebuild.sh`, it presents an interactive main menu with several categories:

-   **Server Operations**: Options to rebuild and/or run your AzerothCore server, update source code, and manage custom modules.
-   **Server Management**:
    -   **Process Management**: Control starting, stopping, and restarting `authserver` and `worldserver`. Check their status within the TMUX session.
    -   **Backup/Restore Options**: Create new backups of your databases and server configurations, or restore from a previously created backup.
    -   **Log Viewer**: Access and view logs generated by the script itself, `authserver`, or `worldserver`.
-   **Configuration & Exit**:
    -   **Configuration Options**: Manage the script's settings. You can view the current configuration, edit the configuration file directly, or reset all settings to their defaults.
    -   **Quit Script**: Exits the `ACrebuild.sh` script.

The script uses `tmux` to run `authserver` and `worldserver` in a manageable session, allowing you to detach and reattach to view server console output.

## Configuration

The `ACrebuild.sh` script uses an external configuration file located at:
`~/.ACrebuild/ACrebuild.conf`

This file is automatically created with default values when you first run the script or if it's missing. You can manage this configuration through the **"Configuration Options"** menu within the script.

Key settings you can configure include:

-   `AZEROTHCORE_DIR`: The path to your AzerothCore installation.
-   `BACKUP_DIR`: The directory where backups will be stored.
-   `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS` (use with caution, leave empty to be prompted), `AUTH_DB_NAME`, `CHAR_DB_NAME`, `WORLD_DB_NAME`: Database connection details for backups and restores.
-   Paths for server configuration and log directories (usually relative to `AZEROTHCORE_DIR`).
-   Filenames for server and script logs.
-   `CORES_FOR_BUILD`: Number of CPU cores to use during the `make` process for faster compilation.

It's recommended to manage these settings via the script's menu, especially for paths, to ensure they are correctly formatted. For sensitive information like `DB_PASS`, the script will always prompt you if it's empty in the configuration file, which is the recommended approach for security.
